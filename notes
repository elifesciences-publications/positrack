Initial notes when started the positrack project

Features:

1) runs on linux
2) use IEEE 1394 interface because it is fast and used by many high-end cameras. Webcam might have been simpler and cheaper but I think IEEE 1394 cam might be better for accurate measurments. Webcams are better to work at home.
3) Linux has built in drivers for IEEE 1394.
3) libdc1394 is the library that provides a complete high level application programming interface (API) for developers (me) who wish to control IEEE 1394 based cameras
    it seems to be the most popular,  has lesser GNU licence.
4) Use Gtk as visual interface (can steel code from kacq), same licence, will be programmed with glade and look similar to the previous tracking program running on windows
5) Use autotools to configure and install, still code from kacq
6) Use comedi to send synchronization pulse to electrophysiological recording setups.
7) Eventually, the tracking software will be able to interact with other computers via comedi (e.g., for stimulation based on mouse position).
8) infra-red could be done with a monochrome firewire camera from imagesource.
9) Use gstreamer for video playback and to get the video from usb webcam.

I now need the new tracking system to do an experiment. I ordered a new firewire camera to track the animal 
with infrared leds. The visual spectrum will be removed with a filter.

So the next steps are...

1) Write the update function for tracked_object, initialize when tracking starts and destroy when tracking ends.

2) Test whether the tracking is not processing everything late. To do: use comedi ttl pulse sent to kacq on each frame and a different one when an object is detected, use an arduino with flashing a led that send a ttl pulse to kacq when led is on. There should be less than 33 ms delay between the time the led is switched on and the time the object is detected.

3) Save tracking data to a text file (anyone can read a text file).
