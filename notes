Initial notes when started the positrack project

Features:

1) runs on linux
2) use IEEE 1394 interface because it is fast and used by many high-end cameras. Webcam might have been simpler and cheaper but I think IEEE 1394 cam might be better for accurate measurments.
3) Linux has built in drivers for IEEE 1394.
3) libdc1394 is the library that provides a complete high level application programming interface (API) for developers (me) who wish to control IEEE 1394 based cameras
    it seems to be the most popular,  has lesser GNU licence.
4) Use Gtk as visual interface (can steel code from kacq), same licence, will be programmed with glade and look similar to the previous tracking program running on windows
5) Use autotools to configure and install, still code from kacq
6) Use comedi to send synchronization pulse to electrophysiological recording setups.
7) Code will be split into 4: camera (IEEE 1394) code, display, tracking, comedi.
8) Eventually, the tracking software will be able to interact with other computers via a AD card driven by comedi driver (e.g., for laser stimulation based on mouse position).
9) Most video processing code will come from our old windows tracking program, with possible improvement where needed.
10) infra-red could be done with a monochrome firewire camera from imagesource.
12) Use gstreamer for video processing.

Despite trouble with firewire source, I still think gstreamer is the right choice because
of its flexibility. We can choose from many pluggins. This should prevent facing the same
problem as now with the old Windows Tracking System. I suspect it will be around for at
least 10 years.

I should not block the development of positrack because I can't figure out how to get the
video input from 1394 camera using gstreamer. I will use a webcam as a sourse for now so
that I can move forward with the rest of the application. In the end, I will only have to
change the source of the video feed. I might even be able to use a webcam to do the
tracking. Who knows.

I now need the new tracking system to do an experiment. I ordered a new firewire camera to track the animal 
with infrared leds. The visual spectrum will be removed with a filter.

The plan is the following. We control the 1394 camera with the libdc library. We set the camera as we want it
and we start the acquisition. We process each frame when it arrives. For the video play back of the data, I will
use a gstreamer pipeline. This will be done using an appsrc element.

So the next steps are
0.0 Build the gtk pipeline according to the video source.
0.1 
1. Get all the information needed from the camera.
2. Set the right sampling rate for the camera.
3. Start the acquisition on the camera.
4. Get frames from the camera.
5. Send each frame to the gstreamer pipeline for playback.
6. Do the tracking of the frame.
