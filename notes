TESTING SYNCHRONIZATION, 05.09.2016

This was done with positrack using the parallel port.

Methods:
      Delays in detecting a flashing LED
      Arduino to flash an LED (500ms on / 500ms off) in the field of view of the camera.
      The 3V pulse powering the LED is splitted and fed into ktan, sampling rate 20 kHz.
      Tracking at ~50 Hz with firewire camera 800.
      Tracking software send set output pulse to 3 V if LED detected, to 0 V if no detection.
      Detect the difference in 0-3 V transition for LED and tracking during a 1 hour recording.

Results: 
      Output positrack file is same length as the number of ttl pusles indicating start of frame processing.
      Difference between frame timestamp and start frame processing is around 20 ms, the exact value is saved in the positrack file.
      The delay between the led turn on and the led detected is between 34 and 60 ms. This delay is explained by the processing time of each frame (10-23 ms) and the delay between frame timestamp and the reception of frame in RAM (20-21 ms). The remaining ms are most likely due to capture time (4-20 ms). 

Conclusion:  Real-time analysis is delayed by approximately 34 to 60 ms.
	     When this is an important factor, use high sampling rate to minimize the delay.
	     For off-line analysis, use the time of the raising phase of ttl (frame in RAM) and subtract the difference between time in RAM and frame timestamp.
	     frame time = time ttl in ram - timestamp frame.
