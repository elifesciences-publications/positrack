Initial notes when started the positrack project

Features:

1) runs on linux
2) use IEEE 1394 interface because it is fast and used by many high-end camera. Webcam might have been simpler and cheaper but I think IEEE 1394 cam might be better for accurate measurments. But we will provide support for both.
3) linux has built in drivers for IEEE 1394.
3) libdc1394 is the library that provides a complete high level application programming interface (API) for developers (me) who wish to control IEEE 1394 based cameras
    it seems to be the most popular,  has lesser GNU licence.
4) use gtk as visual interface (can steel some code from kacq), same licence, will be programmed with glade and based on previous tracking program running on windows
5) will use autotools to configure and install, based on kacq
6) Code will be split into 4: camera (IEEE 1394) code, display, tracking, comedi.
7) The tracking software will be able to interact with other computer via a AD card driven by comedi driver (this will allow laser stimulation based on position).
8) All video processing code will come from our old windows tracking program.
10) infra-red could be done with a monochrome firewire camera from imagesource. 
11) example of capture code in c: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/libdc1394-HOWTO/#example
12) Use gstreamer for video processing.

Despite trouble with firewire source, I still think gstreamer is the right choice because
of its flexibility. We can choose from many pluggins. This should prevent facing the same
problem as now with the old Windows Tracking System. I suspect it will be around for at
least 10 years.

I should not block the development of positrack because I can't figure out how to get the
video input from 1394 camera using gstreamer. I will use a webcam as a sourse for now so
that I can move forward with the rest of the application. In the end, I will only have to
change the source of the video feed. I might even be able to use a webcam to do the
tracking. Who knows.


1-. Get the webcam gstreamer pipeline to display the video feed from a c program (done 12 March 2013) 
2-. Put the video stream in the GUI window (done 13 March 2013)
3-. Build a very basic GUI. Like the old one but with two windows (video and tracking) (done 13 March 2013).
4-. Play and stop video streaming from menu (done 13 March 2013).
5. Design of the tracking loop. What makes more sense? Timer?
6. Get the image buffer from the pipeline, in the right format.
7. Write up the part of the code to do the tracking and develop the GUI further.
8. Add comedi support for synchronization.
9. Implement the firewire source
11. Testing with flashing led to know if there is some jitter. Check if all aligns in dat files.


Problems encountered
1. Can't manage to stream from the 1394 camera
   Using webcam for now.
   Try with another computer when possible
2. Can't compile with the gstreamer-interfaces library 
   remove/reinstall gstreamer-plugins-base-devel and it worked
