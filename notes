Initial notes when started the positrack project

Features:

1) runs on linux
2) use IEEE 1394 interface because it is fast and used by many high-end cameras. Webcam might have been simpler and cheaper but I think IEEE 1394 cam might be better for accurate measurments. Webcams are better to work at home.
3) Linux has built in drivers for IEEE 1394.
3) libdc1394 is the library that provides a complete high level application programming interface (API) for developers (me) who wish to control IEEE 1394 based cameras
    it seems to be the most popular,  has lesser GNU licence.
4) Use Gtk as visual interface (can steel code from kacq), same licence, will be programmed with glade and look similar to the previous tracking program running on windows
5) Use autotools to configure and install, still code from kacq
6) Use comedi to send synchronization pulse to electrophysiological recording setups.
7) Eventually, the tracking software will be able to interact with other computers via comedi (e.g., for stimulation based on mouse position).
8) infra-red could be done with a monochrome firewire camera from imagesource.
9) Use gstreamer for video playback and to get the video from usb webcam.
10) Save tracking data to a text file (anyone can read a text file).



TESTING
Delays in detecting a flashing LED
       Arduino to flash an LED (1000ms on / 1002ms off) in the field of view of the camera.
       The 5V pulse powering the LED is splitted and fed into kacq, sampling rate 20 kHz.
       Tracking at 30 Hz with firewire camera.
       Tracking software send set output pulse to 5 V if LED detected, to 0 V if no detection.
       Detect the difference in 0-5 V transition for LED and tracking during a 1 hour recording.
       Results: 
       There is a delay between 38 to 70 ms (one inter frame interval (33 ms) + tracking time (5 ms))

CONCLUSION:  Real-time analysis will be delayed by approximately 1000/sampling_rate ms.
	     When this is an important factor, use high sampling rate to minimize the delay.
	     For off-line analysis, we will take into account this delay and eliminate it.
